Eric Gordon can run pick and roll, be a catch-and-shoot player, and effectively defend 2's and 3's. I was blown away by this one, but it's clearly a discount to join a team that has a good shot at winning the West next year.\n\nYuta Watanabe - this guy just works his ass off. There's no other way to describe it. He fights and fights on the defensive end, tries to slide in for charges, and does the dirty work. He also has a knack for shooting blistering numbers from the corner. KD being a cool dude helped him get a quality bench piece here as they are notably buddies.\n\nKeita Bates-Diop - this signing makes me really happy for Suns fans. Usually, these top-loaded teams surround stars with washed-up bums who are looking to cling onto someone else's greatness to get them a ring. Bates-Diop is a young athletic wing who's 6'8\" and 230 pounds. This is a guy who will be able to add energy and park and fit nicely alongside the four top-paid players.\n\nOverall, the Suns actually killed it in free agency. I don't think another team did better.\n\nCleveland Cavs - A team that many people, including myself (a Cavs fan), had hopes for moving into last season, were let down in epic proportions. Cleveland's embarrassing performance in the first round of the playoffs left a bad taste in the mouths of their supporters. However, they have made moves that open up possibilities to be better than people think.\n\nMax Strus - This deal was fantastic, plain and simple. The Cavs had Issac Okoro at the small forward position where no one respected him as a three-point shooter, and rightfully so. All of that changes with Strus. Strus was in the fourth percentile of openness on three-point looks last year, meaning teams defended him like their hair was on fire. Teams will have to respect his shooting from outside, and the upgrade from a horrible positional shooter to a potentially elite one opens up a new world for the Cavs' offense. With a team full of willing playmakers, Strus should be able to feast off open looks.\n\nGeorge Niang - The six-foot-seven sniper who can play either the three or the four will be a massive help to the Cavs for similar reasons I mentioned for Strus. His three-point shooting ability alone completely alters how the team will be defended next year. It forces the defense to respect him from the three-point line, creating space for others and allowing the Cavs to experiment with small ball lineups. The Cavs won't be stuck using double big lineups the entire season and could even have a few run-and-gun lineups with Mobley playing the five.\n\nCaris LeVert - As someone who used to dislike LeVert as a player, he has grown on me. He gives his all and has embraced doing whatever it takes to contribute to winning. His defense notably improved last year, and as a bench ball handler and occasional scorer, I'm completely fine with the price he returned. I'm happy to see him back.\n\nThe moral of the story is that the Cavs are better than people are giving them credit for, and they need to be talked about more.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers - The Lakers, coming off a complete team revamp at the trade deadline and a surprising run to the Western Conference with a hobbled LeBron and a tired Anthony Davis, needed to bring back their core and improve around the edges. They managed to do both.\n\nAustin Reaves - Austin Reaves putting up 17-5-5 throughout the postseason and competing on defense as a taller guard made me think he was going to get $100 million. He was legitimately the third-best player on a team that made it to the WCF. Instead, he signed a contract for $4-56 million. The value of this contract is mind-numbing. It's confusing to me how another GM didn't force the Lakers to pay him what he deserved. Lakers fans should be celebrating and keeping this guy for the price they managed to get him at.\n\nRui Hachimura and DLo - The Lakers bring back both of these guys, who I think will make their regular season less strenuous. These are players who can perform in the regular season and help the Lakers with their seeding. We know the Lakers care about championships, but these guys will help them get better positioning for their inevitable postseason run. However, I think both of these contracts are overpays for the talent they bring, and it doesn't sit right with me. Nevertheless, the Lakers needed to retain talent.\n\nTaurean Prince - This signing may seem marginal to a lot of people, often overlooked compared to the Lakers' other signings. However, I love it. As someone who watches the Timberwolves frequently, I was always impressed by Prince's effort. It also doesn't hurt to have wing depth on a team where LeBron is nearing forty years old. I'm a big fan of this signing, and to get him for under five million dollars seems like an awesome value play. The Lakers are not to be trifled with next year; this team is going to be really good barring any injuries.\n\nLOSERS\nHouston Rockets - A team desperate to change their fortunes spent big money. Let's see how it goes.\n\nFVV - I actually like FVV. After a career-worst season, I'm bullish on him returning closer to his usual self. However, good god, that price tag was hefty. I think the argument that he can be a culture setter, table setter, and spacer for a team that desperately needs a mature presence is a good one. I agree with that sentiment. My question is, did they pay FVV like a number one option on a good team? Is that what they expect of him, or did they just want a mature player and were willing to overpay?\n\nDillon Brooks - Again, I'm actually higher on Brooks than most. Being a top 5 defender at his position is impressive. Unfortunately, he may be the worst offensive player at his position and has the ego of an all-time great. That spells disaster. Not only that, the Rockets handed him $20 million a year, which seemed like a gross overpay. If he had received the mid-level exception or slightly more, I would have fully supported the signing. However, with the years and dollar amount they gave him, it just doesn't sit right with me. Hopefully, he takes his medicine from such an embarrassing ending to his career in Memphis and humbles himself.\n\nBrook Lopez - The team missed out on Brook Lopez after weeks of putting it out there in the media that he was a high-level priority for them. Lopez's place on the team is incredibly important as a veteran, leader, floor spacer, and rim protector. With the team striking out on him, I'm a lot less hopeful that their defense will turn around.\n\nOverall, I hate the Rockets. I think their young talent is overrated, and their signings are overpaid. The Rockets are just a complete hypothetical in my eyes. If anyone says anything positive about them for the upcoming season, it's just hopes and dreams.\n\nOrlando Magic - As a team that played their hearts out at the end of the year with two emerging stars, this summer seemed to set them up to push for playoff contention. Unfortunately, they did not make any moves to achieve that.\n\nJoe Ingles - For a team that needs shooting as badly as they do, I probably shouldn't hate this signing as much as I do. However, it just seems like the worst shooting option they could have gone after when there were other options available on the market. Joe Ingles, once a very respectable wing defender and pick-and-roll ball handler, is now old and washed defensively. I still think he adds value as a shooter for a team that desperately needs that skill. But the price tag for a guy as old as he is, when the team had younger options available with their cap space, angered me.\n\nMo Wagner - Mo Wagner's contract is groundbreaking for giving money to trashcan players just because their sibling is a star. Thanasis and Isaiah Mobley, and others alike, have all crowned Mo Wagner the GOAT of all GOATs. Wagner is more of a shit-starter than a good basketball player. It's not a ton of money, but I also don't think this move helps the team in any way. It feels like a \"we need to spend our money\" move instead of investing in someone who could actually make a difference.\n\nFVV - Similar to what I said about FVV above, I'm actually bullish on him returning to form. However, I think the fit in Orlando is much better than in Houston. The expectations for FVV would be to be a third option and table-setter, finally providing spacing at the point guard position. By the time his contract would be up, it would be time to extend Franz and Paolo. So if it wasn't the right move, they wouldn't be handicapped if they wanted to contend with Franz and Paolo.\n\nOverall, I just think the Magic stayed the same when they really could have made significant improvements with the growth of their star wings and by adding quality pieces in free agency and the draft. They had the worst offseason of any team by far.\n\nToronto Raptors - Masai Ujiri, often praised as a basketball savant and genius, is running the Raptors into the ground but is still living off the reputation of the Kawhi trade.\n\nDennis Schroder - I think Dennis proved to everyone during last year's playoff run with the Lakers that he had more left in the tank than most thought. He stayed attached to opposing guards, flopped everywhere, and tricked referees endlessly. But to replace FVV with Dennis Schroder, a worse defender and worse three-point shooter, is gross, especially when the Raptors already have a horrible half-court offense due to their lack of spacing. Nasty work by Masai.\n\nJakob Poeltl - This one is also gross. I'm actually a fan of Poeltl. I think his rim protection and rebounding are really important for the Raptors to have a respectable defense. But they traded a first-round pick to get him because they thought they were going to contend, and then FVV walks out the door? So they traded a top 6 protected first-round pick to pay Jakob Poeltl $20 million a year when their starting franchise point guard left? Paying Poeltl is a move you make if you expect to be good, but they will not be good.\n\nJalen McDaniels - Good job, Masai, with this signing. You've made the Raptors an even worse shooting team than they were last year. This team is going to be dog shit and most likely give their pick to the Spurs, which will be in the range of 7-10. Ujiri has successfully put the Raptors in the \"wizard zone\" where they're good enough to not get good draft picks but never good enough to make the playoffs.\n\nI promise I will not be watching a single Raptors game next year."}},"author":{"name":"J.P.
