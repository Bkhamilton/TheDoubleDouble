This question can have a million different answers, but it seems like in today’s NBA, GMs have found a consensus. Wings that have the ability to handle the ball seem to be the player archetype that all GMs are looking for. You see players like LeBron, KD, Tatum, Luka, Kawhi, Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Jaylen Brown, and Devin Booker. All of these players are 6’6 or taller and capable of creating their own shots with an array of dribble moves or setting up their teammates' shots as well.\nThere is a young player in today’s NBA who, despite being the number one overall draft pick, is being overlooked. Cade Cunningham for the Detroit Pistons has been overshadowed this season because of a season-ending injury and the improved play of the sophomore class while Cade is sidelined. However, this should not deter you from acknowledging how great of a prospect Cade Cunningham is. If I had to break down Cade Cunningham for you, it would go a little bit like this: Cade Cunningham is a 6’6\" guard/wing who excels in creating shots for himself and others and has the ability to switch positions 1 to 3 with ease. He also does all the dirty work, boxing out big men to prevent offensive rebounds, taking charges from players larger than him, moving off the ball to get himself good looks, and staying off the ball if he deems it best for the team. Perhaps most importantly, he’s an all-time leader and teammate, someone who wants to bring out the best in his teammates and will change the culture of an organization.\nNow let's discuss some areas I'd like to see Cade improve on. Consistency is the most significant issue in his young career, and to a certain point, that is expected from a high-volume young player with the responsibility he has. During his best games, he looks like an unstoppable force, but in some games offensively, he struggles to impact the game. For his young career, having played only 76 games up to this point, he’s averaging great counting stats (17.8-5.6-5.6), but with subpar efficiency (41.6 FG%, 30.9 3PT%, 84.4 FT%). This is something I see being easily ironed out with more playing experience and better talent around him. It’s very hard for him to be forgotten as an offensive threat because the talent surrounding him is so poor that all defenses are focusing on him. Another area I would like to see Cade improve on is his turnovers. I consider Cade to be an above-average playmaker, but to become elite, he needs to reduce turnovers and create great opportunities for his teammates. The last thing I would love to see Cade improve on is getting to the free-throw line. If he could draw fouls on opposing bigs, get easy points, and establish a rhythm from the free-throw line, I think that would greatly enhance his efficiency. As a young player, he’s not going to get the same respect as some of the established stars when it comes to getting to the line, but if he consistently adds free-throw shooting to his game, he will be very difficult to stop.\nIn conclusion, Cade is the player, and it’s just up to Detroit to surround him with talent, which they have done a horrible job of up to this point. I don't think it’s debatable; I believe this is the least talented roster in the league despite having some young promising talent. When it comes to their current state, this team is like a desolate land of G-league players in disguise."}}}},{"node":{"title":"The Player All GMs Want","slug":"the-player-all-gms-want","publishedDate":"25/05/2023","content":{"internal":{"content":"If you were running an NBA franchise (which we all dream about), what type of person would you want to start your franchise with?
